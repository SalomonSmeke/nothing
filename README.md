# Do Nothing ðŸ˜´

Once upon a time we all read this brief article about ["do-nothing scripting"](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/).

Very cool.

This repo contains a simple script, `nothing.py` that allows such scripts to be specified as yaml documents.

## Usage

Install the requirements as usual.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To go through a do-nothing script generated from the provided `sample.yml`.

```
python nothing.py sample
```

Add your own yml instructions files and join the fun!
