title: A sample set of do-nothing instructions

# the user will be prompted to provide these values
# and the values will persist through the run
context: 
  - current_user_name
  - what_user_accomplished_today

# a set of steps in an instructions document *must* be represented as a literal yaml block
# https://yaml-multiline.info/#block-scalars
# a new step is denoted exclusively by a blank line
# plain python templates are used to interpolate context
steps: |-
  Take a good look at yourself, {current_user_name}.

  I heard you accomplished something great today: {what_user_accomplished_today}.
  Give yourself a pat on the back!
